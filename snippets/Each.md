## Each
#### jqEach
A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties.
```
$.each(${collection}, function (indexInArray, valueOfElement) { 
	$0 
});
```
